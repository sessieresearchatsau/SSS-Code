Loop, searching for:

1.  Repeating and other 1-D cases, creating net summary (canonical version), put in database, allow look up of first SSS that created that network.

2.  Repeating and other 1-D cases, try to understand the behavior of DistanceLastPositions and DistanceTally.

3.  Non-1-D cases where the SSS/Net tests give different answers.

4.  2-D cases, creating net summary (canonical version), put in database, allow look up of first SSS that created that network.

5.  Exponential cases, logging them, decide how to create a net summary (canonical version), put in database, allow look up of first SSS that created that network.

6.  3-D cases, logging them, decide how to create a net summary (canonical version), put in database, allow look up of first SSS that created that network.

7.  Cases that do not identify as n-dimensional for any integer, nor exponential.  (Skip all known types, look for new stuff!)
